# Gradient App Bar

Love the material AppBar? Do you want to add more color to the appbar? Here's a gradientAppBar.

It works just like the normal AppBar. Also with actions, back buttons, titles. So it's just your normal AppBar, but with a twist!

## Getting Started

1. Depend on it by adding this to your pubspec.yaml file: ```gradient_app_bar: ^0.0.1```

2. Import it: ```import 'package:gradient_app_bar/gradient_app_bar.dart'```

3. Replace your current AppBar (In the scaffold) to GradientAppBar. Add a backgroundColorStart and a backgroundColorEnd and you have a gradient appbar!
